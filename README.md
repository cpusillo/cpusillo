### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Corrine

I am an IT Engineer, specializing in automation. I like to make the tedious stuff a thing of the past!

I have a background in run-of-the-mill System Administration as well as Full Stack Engineering. Right now I am interested in Data Engineering and am looking forward to displaying some of my work.

I hope you will check back in Q2/Q3 2024 to see how my projects are going!

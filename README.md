### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Corrine

I am an IT Engineer, specializing in automation. I like to automate the tedious stuff that ruins our productivity.

I have a background in run-of-the-mill System Administration as well as Full Stack Engineering. My passion is in IT, but I think being able to write effective scripts is so important in our field. I'll be using this github as a repository for any useful scripts I can come up with
